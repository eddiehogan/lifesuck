    <h1>WHY DO PEOLPE COMMIT SUICIDE</h1>
    <p>Some people who end their lives or attempt suicide might be trying to escape feelings of rejection, hurt, or
        loss. Others might feel angry, ashamed, or guilty about something. Some people may be worried about
        disappointing friends or family members. And some may feel unwanted, unloved, victimized, or like they're a
        burden to others.

        We all feel overwhelmed by difficult emotions or situations sometimes. But most people get through it or can put
        their problems in perspective and find a way to carry on with determination and hope. So why does one person try
        suicide when another person in the same tough situation does not? What makes some people more resilient (better
        able to deal with life's setbacks and difficulties) than others? What makes a person unable to see another way
        out of a bad situation besides ending their life?

        The answer to those questions lies in the fact that most people who die by suicide have depression.</p>
